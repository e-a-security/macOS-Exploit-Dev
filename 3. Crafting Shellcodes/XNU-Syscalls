To perform a system call, you put the system call number in %eax, and put the actual exit code to %ebx. 
The system call number can be found in /usr/include/sys/syscall.h.

#define	SYS_syscall        0
#define	SYS_exit           1
#define	SYS_fork           2
#define	SYS_read           3
#define	SYS_write          4
#define	SYS_open           5
#define	SYS_close          6
#define	SYS_wait4          7

The system call number need to add an offset 0x2000000, because OSX has 4 different class of system calls.
