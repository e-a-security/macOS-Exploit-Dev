NAME
     execve -- execute a file

SYNOPSIS
     #include <unistd.h>

     int
     execve(const char *path, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]);

DESCRIPTION
     Execve() transforms the calling process into a new process.  The new
     process is constructed from an ordinary file, whose name is pointed to by
     path, called the new process file.  This file is either an executable
     object file, or a file of data for an interpreter.  An executable object
     file consists of an identifying header, followed by pages of data repre-senting representing
     senting the initial program (text) and initialized data pages.  Addi-tional Additional
     tional pages may be specified by the header to be initialized with zero
     data;  see a.out(5).
